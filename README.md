AD New User Creation Script 1.4 (tailored to LAFLA)


Script was modified to add a Middle Name, fix the UPN generation, add -Database parameter to the Enable-Mailbox commands, and a check for which database a user will be placed in based off a number of checks. The script also generates a user profile location and a temp folder for how our organization is set up.
